match_1=ZodiacMatch.create(zodiac_one:"aries" ,zodiac_two:"aries" ,pro: "A beautiful thing about an Aries and Aries match is that Aries mating with another Aries is like an Aries mating with a mirror Self. Aries gets Aries, because Aries knows Aries, because Aries IS Aries. So, of course Aries is going to understand why their partner always needs to be the boss, always wants to lead, and always wants exciting fireworks around. And Aries doesn't waste time, nor does it like anybody else that does. So this is yet another beautiful thing about this match.
    Aries is also very independent. And does NOT like the kind of mate that needs to text them 50 times before lunch about what they are going to have for lunch. So this is a sign that really appreciates that in another Aries. Aries also loves pursuing, but they also love being pursued, which comes in handy when their mate is another initiator as well. There is no time wasted with Aries and that will work out very well for both of you.",

You can't both be the boss all the time. This is without question an enthusiastic and positive union, but you are going to butt heads once in a while. Aries is symbolized by the Ram, and so if there is any sign that is going to butt heads with you, it is going to be your fellow Aries. Consider yourself warned when you start mating with an Aries, the clash of the egos is inevitable, and will likely be the thing the two of you fight about the most.
    Being Cardinal Fire Signs, tempers will also flare with Aries matches. But you know how to handle fire in your earthly life, they are easily quashed with the right extinguisher. Same thing applies to an Aries upon Aries explosion. Soften the blows and the sparks with the positive traits of Aries, generosity and indulgences, and the fire won't last long.",

Now, that being said, these wars are not going to stop the world from turning, even if it feels that way at the time. Yes you will argue, but if you are going into a love experience expecting it to be perfect ALL the time, I'm telling you right now it is going to fizzle out, whether you are an Aries or not. The beautiful thing about Aries is that as fire signs, it ALWAYS fizzles out, and it usually fizzles out pretty quickly if you remember the positive traits in each other, and nurture each other through those fiery wars when they do erupt. Note I did not say if, but when. It's going to happen, prepare yourself, and be the best loving partner you can be, and that fire won't last long. One thing you two are never going to be short of is passion, so use your spontaneous side to your advantage, and when the fiery wars begin, let them be overcome with passion. By the time all is said and done, you'll forget what you were even fighting about.",

Did you guess fireworks? You were right. This is perhaps the most passionate and fiery match in the zodiac. This is what happens when you put two born leaders together that have the fire in their bellies to succeed in all areas of life. But is your love life always going to look like the Fourth of July? Not always. Most of the time, yes. But what happens when it isn't? Here's the good, the bad, and the how to make it work with an Aries and Aries match.")

As the Cardinal Fire Sign then, Aries passion is unprecedented. With Taurus being ruled by Venus, Taurus is patient, gentle, and sexy as all get go. So there will never be a shortage of sparks with this pair. Taurus looks for someone that goes after what they want in life, and will love this quality the most in Aries, not to mention Aries unrelenting passion. Taurus also offers security and a long-term vision, that Aries loves in both work and play. If Aries can have a partner to come home to that will never keep them guessing what game they are playing next, they will love that quality the most in their Taurus. Aries is ruled by Mars, a very masculine energy, and Taurus is ruled by Venus, a polar feminine energy. And you know what happen when Mars and Venus get together. It can be always great, if they let it.",

If Taurus wants something that Aries doesn't, the sparks that will be flying will not be exciting to say the least. Taurus as a Fixed Sign also has a bit of a tendency to be possessive. Independent warrior Aries will have little to no patience for that. Who needs to bend on these matters? They both do. Taurus needs to learn flexibility and that life is not fixed on one mission at all times, while Aries needs to use a little extra energy to remind Taurus, frequently, that their fire doesn't necessarily mean they are a wanderer. Aries will also need to accept that they can't get their way, ALL the time, if they want this match to work.",

One side is impulsive, that's you, Aries, the other is deliberate and considerate. That is Taurus.

The more committed these two are to learning more about each other and how to make it work, the greater the chance they have at creating a balance between impulsivity and groundedness. It will be slow to get moving with Taurus influence, but if Aries is patient, the groundwork will pay off handsomely for them in love.",

This could go one of a few ways, and it will all depend on the commitments of the individuals, to the union as a whole. Aries is ruled by Mars, the warrior, and Taurus is ruled by Venus, the lover. So in this match we have both the Lover and the Fighter and balance will be necessary from both parties in order to make it work. Aries will however always be Taurus hero, and Taurus likes that. A lot. But Aries will want to be diving in and jump starting the relationship and every factor very early on, which will not go over well with Taurus. If Aries can dial down the speed while amping up the charm, and Taurus can try out their spontaneous side a little more, this will be a match made in heaven.")

Gemini as an Air Sign thinks, and thinks a lot, and is very good on the communication front for Aries. Aries likes the intellectual side of Gemini, and this match makes for many long nights of conversation by the fire. Gemini also likes that Aries is the decision maker, though Gemini will need to have some control in this area in order for this to work.",

Aries will also not like Gemini's need for constant bickering or arguing, and will need to understand this is just Gemini talking or thinking out loud. The less of this bickering that Aries takes personally, the more luck and chances this union has of making it work. As a general rule though, Aries has a tough time with that and so when sparks are flying between these two, it could get ugly very fast.",

And it will be Aries first that will have had enough. If Gemini wants to cling to their Aries, they need to give Aries the freedom and individuality that they also want most. Balance and working in unison with each other will prevail over ego driven arguments. Both parties need to give in a little bit more and exercise flexibility if they want this match to last for a long haul.

Gemini doesn't like controlling, unless they are the ones holding the sword, and this could get dicey with Aries. Both sides will need to pull back on control issues, and Aries flexibility bone will need to be stretched just a little bit more.

Cancer also wants just what Aries wants, a happy home life, and so Aries will never complain about the home center that Cancer putters to every single day. The instinct of the watery Cancer will also help Aries get as far as they want, and wherever they want in life, which of course Aries really loves.",

Cancer is among the most sensitive signs of the zodiac, and has a tendency to take everything personally. They are also known for being stubborn, and often attack with their own pinches, so when Aries points something out they don't like, they had better put their armor on because it is going to sting for them too. No matter what. Aries will be the first to bail on this union as a result, if there is any bailing to be had. So Cancer really needs to be careful in how they manage their feelings in conflict. Cancer also is not nearly as independent as Aries, and this could wear Aries down a bit. If Cancer doesn't get the cherished feelings they want in love, Cancer also could be the first to bail, Aries take heed here.",

Aries will never worry about who makes the first move, because Cancer is always right on that. In this pair, Cancer will be in charge of the emotional bliss of this union, and Aries will be in the lead when it comes to fighting off intruders and enemies.

So this match has all of the signs of a steamy and passionate one, so long as both parties are able to put their egos aside, at least some of the time. Both signs are incredibly emotional, but Aries is in their fiery and passionate way, whereas Cancer wants to over analyze every feeling that comes their way.

As the Fixed Sign, Leo loves relationships that last, and falls in love with the object of their fixation very easily. It's also pretty tough to get Leo's eyes off The One, so Aries will really appreciate that in their Leo mate. Aries may have a problem with Leo's flirty nature, and constant need for attention, but Aries will find that all of that is superficial. If Leo has declared love to Aries, there will be little if anything that Aries can do to change their mind. Aries also loves Leo's loyal side, and highly respects how this commands a strong friendship with this match. This is a match however with two masculine energies, so there may be a clash of the egos on occasion. Both mates will need to learn flexibility in order to keep the fires burning. On the upside, this is another match where the makeup sex will be outstanding. ",

The fights will be as grand as the makeup sex, but will you survive them? Volatile fights with a lot of damaged egos are the potential for this pair if they don't put aside their grandiose sense of Self once in a while. With all of this fire energy going on, both signs are also on the move quite a bit. Leo in particular will find Aries movement even too quick for them on occasion. Leo will have to hold off on the resentment and petty pouting if they want their Aries to stick around. Aries too needs to shine some light on Leo as often as possible, feeling respect isn't enough for Leo, you will need to show it too.",

Virgo is fussy and detail oriented, this will drive Aries nuts but will be appreciated by Aries in the long term. Aries will appreciate what they learn from Virgo when it comes to patience as well. Aries is used to getting everything their way quickly in life, and will learn from Virgo that just as many blessings can arrive by taking the slower approach. Aries also has a deep appreciation and admiration for the Virgo work ethic.",

Finding the balance between these major personality differences will be the greatest challenge for this match. Virgo wants to analyze and think about just about everything, and Aries can learn to adopt this trait, or at least be flexible with it. Aries can use a little bit more grounding in life, as much as Virgo can stand learning how to be spontaneous and energetic. Not everything needs to be thought through so completely with Virgo, and Aries is the perfect one to teach them this. If they can survive the fights over Aries impulsive ways.",

Virgo does need to get out a bit more though, and not be so afraid of spontaneous energy and activity. Aries is the perfect one to bring this out in Virgo.

And Libra will love Aries ability to provide all of the luxuries they like. Libra is always balancing the pros and cons, and thus a difficult decision maker. Aries will either bring this out in them, or become skilled as the decision maker in the pair. This could even provide relief for the overwhelmed Libra. Harmony and partnership are favored and ruled by Libra, so if Aries is looking for someone for the long haul, a Libra match is one of the best.",

So both of these signs will find themselves very frustrated with their partner over the very same thing they are guilty of themselves. Libra will also become frustrated with Aries impetuous and impulsive nature, as Libra likes to weigh everything at all times. Aries then will feel encumbered and weighed down by Libra's need to pause every five minutes to think about something. Libra's pause can sometimes lead to manipulation on their part as well, which Aries will get pretty riled up over.

With time and a little effort, it will not take much for this couple to realize that the other person balances out exactly what they need in life, and fills in the blanks of their own sense of Self by serving as their polar opposite. It is one of those matches that both mates will fall in love with the very things that irritate each other down the road, but with commitment, this will be the very quality that keeps this united gelled tight.",

The one personality trait that both of these signs possess that will work very well for them is loyalty, and when both of them draw from this trait in their explosive moments, they will find this trait can carry them both for the long haul. Both of these signs need to win, all of the time, and the combined forces of their power and warrior natures will be a force to be reckoned with for as long as they are willing to experience.

Aquarius will be very good as well at keeping Aries on task and en point when it comes to completing tasks or even requests in love, and should continue to do this in order to see their relationship thrive. Aries on the other hand should pull back from the jealousy and possessiveness, and realize that once their fixed sign gets a fix on them, they are in it for the long haul. When both of these signs can overcome these individual insecurities, theirs is truly a cosmic connection.",

A great foundation to this match is always found in friendship, and the communication between these two is inspiring to many other couples.

So having a Cardinal Fire Sign of Aries around, one that takes charge all of the time and initiates absolutely everything, will go over very well with Pisces. Pisces not only likes that, but they need it, and so this will make for a very compatible pair that is always meeting each other's needs, and satisfying each other's wants. Both Aries and Pisces are also very creative, and so this is also a very inspiring match as well. They both exert their creativities a little bit differently. Aries is with energy, whereas Pisces is usually with something artistic. As the Mutable Water Sign, the most flexible of the bunch, Pisces literally fills any container that is put in front of them. So having Aries decide exactly what container that is works out very well for both of them. This is a very giving and loving match that is almost destined to work.",

Pisces is consummately sensitive, and you really do need to tread carefully, and this could get on Aries nerves very easily. Aries tempers will not be easily recovered from for Pisces, so one fight could very well be their last. Aries ego can have a tendency to evaporate Pisces vision, and this will also lend to some problems for this pair. Aries simply needs to pull back on that ego a little more around Pisces. And Pisces will need to learn not to take things so personally.",

This will be very easy for mutable and flexible Pisces, who doesn't want drama and just wants to go with the flow anyway. For this one to be a match for the long term, Pisces needs to go with the flow emotionally as well, and be flexible on that front and not take so much so personally. Aries as well can direct this with their leadership skills, but also needs to pull back on the jumping to conclusions. Both Aries and Pisces are also incredibly independent, when they give each other exactly the freedom they need, this match will grow and flourish. Aries needs to let Pisces retreat to the cave once in a while without feeding their jealousy bone. Pisces needs to remember Aries can't read their mind when they are upset about something. With both of them allowing each other's differences to be celebrated, this will be a very steamy and successful connection for as long as they want it to be.",

Aries on the other hand will be fascinated by the intuition and fantasy world of the dreamy Water Sign of Pisces. Both are very impulsive which could land them both in trouble, but when it comes to road tripping and hot dates, will create a steam to their relationship that neither will want to walk away from quickly.")

These are not individuals that will rush into love, but will take their time sensually coming to know and love each other, until the commitment is made. And as Fixed Signs, and loyal and stubborn ones at that, once they do, that commitment has wonderful chances of lasting a lifetime.

Once a Taurus wants someone, they want no other, and this can lead to not only jealous energy but possessive energy as well. The downside to this, a Taurus will stand by their opinion no matter what evidence is presented to the contrary. This is good when it comes to confirming their love, but not so good when fights and arguments will crop up. If left unchecked, this match will be one with a non stop battle of true Taurean will.",

As well, Taurus is very easy to please when it comes to romance and charm, and Taurus mates know this well about each other. In order for the Taurus mates to get through the challenges that will crop up, they simply need to remember all of the great things that they fell in love with the other, commitment, loyalty, charm, and the odd gift of a pretty thing or two won't hurt in keeping Taurus Taurus match happy and complete through each of their inevitable anniversary parties.",

Taurus is seeking a partner that is both dependable and secure, and Gemini will offer that if their needs are met as well. Gemini's intelligence will often save the day in this case, as Gemini will be on to what Taurus needs and wants much earlier than some other partners might be.",

Gemini is also a Mutable sign, and may have a bit of a wandering eye, or at least a desire to flirt around. This will not exactly go over with the jealous and stubborn Taurus so Gemini needs to curb this enthusiasm just a little bit. Gemini also needs to be honest with Taurus and be very clear on their intentions if they want to avoid the wrath of this Bull. Taurus loves genuine people, a trait that Gemini sometimes needs to work on. But honesty, even if it is not the best news, will win over a Taurus heart any day.",

Taurus won't want to be out having fun every night, but needs to accept that Gemini does and needs at least a little bit of freedom in areas of this nature. Gemini on the other hand needs to realize that if Taurus seems obsessive and jealous, it is a great sign that they are absolutely crazy about them, and as a Fixed Sign, that often means for life. Gemini also needs to remember that trying to snow their Taurus is going to backfire big time, and Gemini just needs to have some security and confidence in themselves to show their real self to Taurus.

Taurus is ruled by Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, and Cancer is ruled by the emotional Moon. There is almost nothing but love shared between these two! Both parties are very feminine energies, so there are deep emotional bonds here that will sustain and nurture both Taurus and Cancer for the long term. Cancer really likes how open and real and grounded Taurus is, and learns how to open up out of their shell a bit more the longer Taurus is around.

Cancer is also a Cardinal Sign, and does not just prefer to be the boss, needs to be or the pinchers come out, no matter who you are. This will not always bode well for Taurus's Bull side. Taurus doesn't need to be the boss at all, but certainly doesn't appreciate being wrong, ALL the time.",

Cancer needs to learn to not take everything Taurus does so personally, and Taurus needs to pay just a smidge more attention than with most people to Cancer's feelings. Cancer also needs to ease off on the ordering Taurus around, if they want Taurus to stick around.

They both love intimacy, as sensual as it can get, and Leo's generosity is almost impossible to match in the zodiac. Naturally, Taurus just loves this. So the honeymoon phase of this union will be a grand one indeed. Leo's masculine energy complements Taurus feminine energy very well, adding to the love compatibility of the Taurus Leo match overall. This relationship overall will radiate the warmth of the Sun, the groundedness of the Earth, the sparks of the Fire, and the sexy, loving, beauty of Venus. Who could ask for anything more?",

As well, both Taurus and Leo are Fixed Signs, which means this relationship offers the potential for battle of the wills. It is not a matter of if, it is going to happen, but when. So both parties need to be forewarned on this. The shadow side of Fixed Signs is that they are jealous, obsessive, and possessive, and Taurus and Leo have these qualities in abundance. It could make for a very paranoid and insecure relationship, as both Taurus and Leo have these issues to work through when they come together.",

That's why this is such a jealous match, because neither can bear the other to leave them. But this same quality as fierce as it will make fights some time will also ignite the sparks of passion the Taurus Leo match is known for. The makeup sex will be out of this world, another reason this pair does not want to let the other go any time soon. If it is Leo that needs to unruffled the feathers, some pretty gifts or a trip to the jewellery store will actually go over very well with Taurus. Leo is very loving and forgiving, and will forget any mistakes Taurus makes if Taurus piles on the flattery and pumps up the ego as genuinely and authentically as possible.

Where Virgo is the more practical of the two, Taurus is the more sensual and beauty driven of the two, and so these polar energies will play off each other beautifully. Both signs have a strong moral compass as well, and don't feed any bull to each other. Taurus loves this, because Taurus always finds it so difficult to find someone that can just be real for a change. Virgo also has no tolerance for fakes, and loves this same quality in Taurus as well. Virgo is also ruled by Mercury, which will deepen communication in this love match.

Taurus sensitivity or the infamous Bull side will come out if Virgo pushes this envelope. As well, where Virgo is ready to be flexible in any situation, Taurus is fixed, and usually fixed to whatever they decide. Getting Taurus to move off of a rock is about as easy as getting a Bull to do exactly what you want to do, and when. Yes, this could create conflict of epic proportions.",

Taurus will need to learn and adapt to Virgo's flexible nature, and be willing to budge on their positions a little more often than they are used to. Virgo also could stand to hold back on the criticism, especially with their partner, and they will find the daily life a lot more breezy and conflict free.

So not only will they be successful financially, but they are both committed to making it work, and will literally do anything to make that happen. Once Taurus gets their sights on a Virgo, Virgo may as well start the ring shopping or ring hinting.

These qualities are the strengths of both of these zodiac signs, and so to many this pairing may even seem dull. But the commitment in both wanting the same thing will often prevail over any matters of boring, and gives this relationship a strong and grounded foundation that will stand the test of time.")

Taurus loves the way Aquarius thinks outside the box, and loves that Aquarius is as honest as the day is long. Aquarius really appreciates how practical Taurus is, and the work ethic that keeps them very successful. Taurus will also find themselves learning and growing under the Aquarius wing, and Aquarius will get their head out of the clouds under Taurus love and care. But when differences arise, as they are bound to, there could be conflict with this pair that will be difficult to get away from.",

Arguments will be heated, opinionated, and will likely be very long, because swaying or coming to the other side is very difficult for either one of them. As well, Taurus does not react quietly to anger, and so not only will the Bull's fights be long, but they will also be loud. Both of these signs are innately jealous as well, but Aquarius has a more unconventional approach to that that will not be taken lightly by Taurus. Aquarius will not like the pressure that Taurus is continuously putting on the relationship, and Taurus will not always go after Aquarius's need to one-up everyone intellectually.",

Aquarius on the other hand could use a few more quiet nights in, and dull days once in a while. Neither one of these partners adapts to change well, that is the nature of the Fixed Sign. But when both Taurus and Aquarius are able to recognize this and actually work on this in order to excel in their love match, excellence indeed is precisely what will result. Both Taurus and Aquarius also need to learn resiliency and flexibility when it comes to disagreements, as both will want to be right all the time, and this is a recipe for disaster.

So this love compatibility is rich with an emotional foundation and connection. Taurus loves the dreamy and fantasy side of Pisces, who feeds Taurus sensuality as often as they want it. Pisces also appreciates the down to Earth and real nature of Taurus, and also that Taurus is loyal. Some signs may get turned off by Taurus jealousy, but it actually feeds Pisces ego, and Pisces is just about the only sign that is actually flattered by Taurus possessive nature. Even so, it can get much for even Pisces at times.",

Pisces also prefers big dreamy parties, whereas Taurus prefers to stay in with their amour. This will lead to many fights that Pisces will find Taurus very stubborn in. And if pushed to the shove, the Taurus jealousy is going to make Pisces cut loose for good.

Taurus as well will need to earn this flexibility from Pisces however, and can do so by giving their Pisces as much room as they are comfortable with. In other words, the Taurus jealousy streak needs to be kept at bay, despite the fact that Pisces will be the most flexible with it. Taurus is also well known for their temper, and Pisces for their hurt feelings. Taurus will need to keep this in check, if they want to keep their Pisces in check as well.

And Gemini can cut it like a sword but they really can't take the blow and will harbor a grudge for a very long time. Being Mutable works to their advantage, but this relationship at the long term level has the potential to build a path of resentment over time.

Scorpio needs to feel secure in love, and can get this for themselves by assuring their partner of the same security they crave.

This does not bode well for Scorpio who is known to be jealous and possessive. These traits of Scorpio aren't so easy to just 'pull back' for Scorpio.

Aquarius finds this too much sometimes, and might even feel stifled by it. Scorpio on the other hand doesn't understand why Aquarius can't emote a little bit more.

Pisces on the other hand is one that wears their heart on their sleeve, and wants to talk about emotions all of the time. So Pisces may become frustrated with Capricorn's rational approach, and Capricorn may become tired or overwhelmed with Pisces emotional approach. Pisces is also easily wounded emotionally, and Capricorn has a critical side that can be taken the wrong way. A meeting of the minds and compromise will be required on both parts for this love to stand the test of time.",
    maximize: "In order for Capricorn and Pisces to make it work, they both will need to be focused on just that, making it work. Differences between the two will need to be overcome, and both Capricorn and Pisces will need to be committed to compromise. Pisces will need to exercise their mutable nature when Capricorn is a little too unyielding to new ideas. At the same time, Capricorn could stand to exercise a little more adventure in their life, and be willing to explore fantasies with Pisces. Capricorn also wants a devoted partner, can mutable Pisces stop flitting from one romance to the next long enough for Capricorn? If they can, this is a match where the zodiac signs will complement each other in harmonious love for a long time to come.",
    match_id: 75, description: "When Capricorn and Pisces first come together in love compatibility, it will be a situation where opposites seem to prevail. This is only a surface glance however, and if both Capricorn and Pisces are willing to give this relationship a whirl, they will find a mutually satisfying and devoted experience that they won't want to let go of. Capricorn adores Pisces emotional and kind approach to life. Pisces loves how Capricorn can ground them with just a smile. This Water and Earth combination is one that will nurture each other through almost any test, so long as they can stay focused on the task at hand, which is success in love.")

    pro: "The good thing about the Aquarius and Aquarius match is that they both think the same, and they both approach love the same way. Both of the partners in this match are Fixed Signs, and as a result they are both committed to making love work. Even if they break up, years later they may find each other because that's the nature of fixed signs. So if this couple falls in love, this relationship will experience a lot of loyalty and devotion that could stand any relationship test. Both Aquarius and Aquarius are big thinkers that function with humanity to make the world a better place. So they will both really enjoy doing this with, and for each other. There are going to be a lot of intellectual conversations between these two as well, and this is going to be deeply attractive to both parties in this match. As a dual Air Sign match, we also have a lot of energy in play here. Aquarius is elegant, and charming, and the little social butterfly. So this couple will have a lot of fun nights out together, and could even be the talk of the town!",
    con: "The Aquarius energy is one that is a Fixed Sign energy and this poses some problems when we multiply that energy times two in love. Fixed Signs are great thinkers and definitely devoted to making love work, but the Aquarius Fixed Sign is one with a will that is almost unbreakable. Here we have two people that some consider to be the most stubborn sign, so putting these energies together can lead to a butting of heads. Both want to control love in their own respective ways, and as fiercely loyal as they are, they are also fiercely jealous. At the same time, the double Air Sign match is one that has a more rational approach than an emotional one. The party in this union that needs emotion on occasion may find themselves carrying the short stick.",
    maximize: "In order for the Aquarius and Aquarius match to work, they will need to find a little bit of flexibility. And this means that both parties in this match need to work on this trait. Both Aquarius and Aquarius can also stand to show each other a little emotion and gratitude on occasion. There will be some times when the stubborn wills come into play, but if both remember the foundation that they started this union on, they will have no problem meeting each other halfway. Appreciation and love are what will make this match work, and emotions are something Aquarius struggles with. With the shared goal of successful love however, these Fixed Signs will be able to fix their emotions and their shared intellect on each other for as long as they want.",
    match_id: 76, description: "When Aquarius and Aquarius combine in the game of love compatibility, there is a lot of harmony to spread all around. This is a match with two zodiac signs that bring very similar perspectives and energies to the table. There is a lot of chemistry between Aquarius and Aquarius, and a foundation that starts with a great friendship. As a dual Air Sign match, they also have the same energy levels, and will appreciate this in each other. Where this match may experience trouble is the lack of emotional overtures, but if both of the Aquarians in this match are committed, they will make up for that in spades with their combined rational approaches to making love work.")

    pro: "The Aquarius and Pisces match is a quirky one indeed, as both zodiac signs are very different in their approaches. Here we have the Fixed Air Sign of Aquarius paired with the Mutable Water Sign of Pisces. Both have a grander vision of the world and are inspired by random acts of kindness and unconditional love. Pisces approach is a bit slower than Aquarius, but Aquarius is deeply attracted to the Pisces kind touch.  At the same time, Aquarius is committed to the unconventional side of life, which Pisces will enjoy when they introduce all of their fantastic fantasies. Pisces is ruled by Neptune and enjoys exploring a deeper and spiritual side to life. Aquarius is fascinated by this, and will join Pisces on many of these explorations. This is a match that will be slow to start, but will begin with an exciting friendship that will lead to an even more exciting love.",
    con: "There are some different qualities coming to play in this union that could pose some problems for Aquarius and Pisces. In this match we have Aquarius who is very fixed on the person that they love, with an undying loyalty and devotion. Pisces appreciates that, but as a Mutable Sign, Pisces is a bit of a wanderer. The strong will of Aquarius as well is not one that Pisces will favor, as Pisces doesn't like to be pushed or coerced into anything. At the same time, overly dramatic emotional displays that Pisces is known for, will not fly with the rational Aquarius. This will confuse Pisces, who will want more emotion out of Aquarius and will have a hard time getting it. The pace here between the two is also very different. Aquarius is always moving and shaking, while Pisces is often retreating to the cave.",
    maximize: "Can the match between Aquarius and Pisces work? It can if both parties are willing to put in the effort. Pisces needs emotional grounding in order to feel worthy in love, and Aquarius will need to balance their rational side and their less than emotional side for Pisces. Pisces on the other hand needs to curb back the emotional manipulation on occasion, and cater to Aquarius thinking side when troubles arise. At the same time, this pair needs to compromise on energy levels. When Aquarius wants to go out for the night, Pisces should join in on the fun, or at least this pair should take turns choosing events. At the same time, Pisces will need to show Aquarius devotion and loyalty if they want this match to last.",
    match_id: 77, description: "In the Aquarius and Pisces match we have a lot of love compatibility to pass around. Although at first glance the Aquarius and Pisces match may have too many differences to count, both of the signs have a lot to offer each other. Here we have the Fixed Air Sign of Aquarius joining forces with the dreamy Mutable Waters of Pisces. Both of the zodiac signs in this match have a greater vision of humanity, and as such, are able to appreciate kindness and unconditional love in each other. Their paces are different, and so too will their approaches be in love. But with harmony as the focus, this is a match that will be able to overcome almost anything.")

    pro: "The Pisces and Pisces match is another match that to many will feel like a soul filled connection. This is a romance where two signs are influenced by Jupiter and Neptune, so we have double Neptune and double Jupiter energy coming into play here. Both Pisces and Pisces will explore the big wide world, and the entire universe, together, and will enjoy every delicious second. This is one of those relationships where both will always be amazed at just how easy the relationship feels, and how easily the other one 'gets' each other. Each of the Pisces in this pair adores how kind the other one is, and is only too happy to show them their gratitude. At the same time, we have two Mutable energies in play here. This means that both of the zodiac signs in this match are very flexible with one another. There will be little drama here, as both are so easygoing they get along with each other splendidly, even when they don't!",
    con: "As easygoing as both of the Pisces in this match will be, sometimes they can be a little too Mutable. Whenever there are two Mutable Signs together, a romance could have problems lifting off the ground because both signs are on the wishy-washy side. So with Pisces and Pisces we do see this problem as a potential, as neither Pisces is really thinking too far ahead. If one is in the relationship at a different pace than the other, this could cause some problems in love. Additionally mutable signs, and particularly Pisces, have a sense of wandering in love for this very reason. When conflict arises Pisces disappears, and sometimes even when it doesn't. Both Pisces will need to be sure they are putting into the relationship exactly what they want if they want to keep their Pisces by their side.",
    maximize: "The Pisces and Pisces match is a very laid back relationship and one that may be the most easygoing relationship in the zodiac. Both Pisces and Pisces are generally nice people, and don't like to rock the boat too much in anything, and this includes love. There will be a little bit of drama with all of this emotion from the dual Water Signs happening, however it won't necessarily be enough to squash the romance. Where this couple will likely have the most problems is in taking off. This is a couple that will be slow to start, and even slower to commit, so it is best that this conversation is had early on. If they can make it past this point, at the end of the day, there is enough love and romance flowing between this easygoing couple, that smoothing out any wrinkles will be relatively easy for them.",
    match_id: 78, description: "If there is one match that has all other matches beat in the game of romance, that would be the Pisces and Pisces connection. This is the mating of two Mutable Water Signs, and so all of the love and romance that anyone needs is tied up in one very emotional bow in this match. The Pisces and Pisces match ranks very high on the love compatibility. These two Water Signs are emotional, intuitive, creative, and spiritual, and thus know exactly what the other needs and wants almost all of the time. The air of kindness from both also serves this romance well, and neither will like drama so this will be at a minimum as well. Of course, as always, when there are this many emotions in play the waters can get rough. But Pisces and Pisces will be able to get through it, if that's what they both want.")
